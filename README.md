# CS50 Programming Language Python (CS50P) Portfolio

Welcome to my CS50P repository! This repository contains my solutions for the Problem Sets and Final Project from Harvard's CS50 Programming Language Python course. Each folder within this repository corresponds to a specific Problem Set or project.

## Course Overview

CS50P is an introduction to programming with Python, covering the following key concepts:

1. **Basic Syntax**: Understanding variables, data types, and functions.
2. **Conditionals**: Implementing decision-making logic with `if` statements and Boolean values.
3. **Loops**: Utilizing `while` and `for` loops for iteration and list manipulation.
4. **Functions**: Defining and using functions, including scope and nested functions.
5. **Tests**: Using unittesting library into different old code sheets.
6. **File I/O**: Reading from and writing to files, handling CSV data.
7. **Regular Expressions**: Using regex for pattern matching and text manipulation.
8. **Object-Oriented Programming**: Creating and managing classes and objects.
